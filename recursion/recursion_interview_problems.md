# Recursion Interview Problems

1. **Reverse-String:**

    This interview question requires you to reverse a string using recursion. Make sure to think of the base case here.

    Again, make sure you use recursion to accomplish this. **Do not slice (e.g. string[::-1]) or use iteration, there muse be a recursive call for the function.**

2. **String Permutation:**

   **Problem Statement**: Given a string, write a function that uses recursion to output a list of all the possible permutations of that string.

   For example, given s='abc' the function should return ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']

   *Note: If a character is repeated, treat each occurence as distinct, for example an input of 'xxx' would return a list with 6 "versions" of 'xxx'*

3. **Fibonnaci Sequence**
